# PyCIRCLean_tests
This repo contains test files for the [PyCIRCLean](https://github.com/CIRCL/PyCIRCLean) project. The files are organized into two directories: files that we expect PyCIRCLean to identify as "Normal" and files that we expect PyCIRCLean to identify as "Dangerous". There is also a file called [file_catalog.md] that lists all of the sample files, along with their description, source, and date added.


## How do I name sample files?

- If downloaded, use original filename and include link to source.
- If generated, make the filename descriptive about the file's characteristics.
